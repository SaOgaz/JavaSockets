With the publications of Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814)
and Emma (1815), she achieved success as a published writer. She wrote two additional novels, Northanger Abbey 
and Persuasion, both published posthumously in 1818, and began a third, eventually titled Sanditon, but died 
before its completion. Her novels have rarely been out of print, although they were published anonymously and 
brought her little fame during her lifetime. A significant transition in her posthumous reputation occurred in 
1869, fifty-two years after her death, when her nephew's publication of A Memoir of Jane Austen introduced her 
to a wider audience.
